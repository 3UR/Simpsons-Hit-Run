# SRR2

> [!WARNING]  
> This repository is far from finished.
> Everything has been upgraded and is compileable but there is still a lot of TODOs to complete before this can even run on UWP or run normally

# TODO
- Better README when stuff.
- Split SRR2 project to just be like a library maybe name it "game_code" then have the projects "game" (windows). and "game_uwp" (uwp) containing the entrypoint and init logic for the platform.
- Implement DirectX 11 for UWP.
- Resolve all symbol errors with the SRR2 project.
- Remove any references and code to things like RAB_XBOX, RAD_PS2
